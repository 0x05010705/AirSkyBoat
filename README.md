Bug Reports and Unimplemented Features
========
You can find the tracker here: https://github.com/project-topaz/topaz/issues

Make sure both your FFXI client and the Topaz server are fully updated (and servers have been rebuilt with the latest code), to check the commit log since your last known update to see if the bug has already been fixed, and to use GitHub's search to see if the bug already been reported, before submitting a new bug report.

Bug reports should include steps to reproduce the bug.

We do take issues detailing unimplemented features _if_ the feature is _retail behavior_, and the issue report adequetly covers everything about that feature which is missing.
