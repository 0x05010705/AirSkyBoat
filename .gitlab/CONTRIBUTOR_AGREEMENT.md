# Ixion Limited Contributor License Agreement
(Updated March 08, 2021)

**By submitting a Pull Request to Ixion ("Us", "We", "Our"), You represent, warrant, and agree:**
* **1. Representations and Warranties; Indemnification**
  * You have the legal authority to enter into this Agreement
  * You own the Copyright and patent claims covering Your Contribution, and that such claims may not also be claimed by third parties, including Your school or employer
  * The rights You grant Us do not violate any grant of right You have made to third parties, or any other rights owned by third parties
  * Your Contribution can be legally licensed under the GPLv3 or its later versions
  * You shall, at Our request, indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Ixion, its affiliates, and its officers from and against any and all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, expenses and costs (including reasonable attorneys' fees), arising from your breach, or alleged breach, of this Section 1.
* **2. Contribution License**
* You grant to Us a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, transferable, royalty-free, irrevocable license to, at any time, and without notice to You:
  * License or relicense, and then convey, the Contribution under any version of the GPL
  * Add to, modify, or remove from the Contribution any Additional Permissions under Section 7, Additional Terms of the GPLv3 license, provided:
    * The Additional Permission is or was a reasonable attempt to increase user modification, server customization, or project adoption; and 
    * The Additional Permission would not violate the terms of a hypothetical _GPLv3_ license which _lacks_ Additional Permissions
  * Add to, modify, or remove from the Contribution any supplemental _non-permissive_ terms which are allowed under Section 7, Additional Terms of the GPLv3
  * License or relicense, and then convey, the Contribution under any version of the Ixion License, provided:
  	* That version of the Ixion License does not violate the terms of a GPLv3 license (_with_ any supplemental non-permissive terms allowed under Section 7, Additional Terms); and
  	* In the event that version of the Ixion License would violate a term of the GPLv3 license, the rest of the Ixion License will remain in the full effect allowed by the GPLv3
* All references to the GNU General Public License may, at Our sole option, and without notice to You: 
	* Be updated to any later version of that license, and we may relicense Your Contribution under that later version
	* Any restrictions placed on the terms for which We may license Your Contribution may be updated to reference that later version
* **3. Compensation; Attribution; Waiver**
  * The potential inclusion of Your Contribution in Ixion is the only compensation for Your Contribution. You are not entitled to any payments, royalties, or other consideration of any kind.
  * We may, but are not required to, include attribution to You in files which Ixion uses to track or list contributors, such as an AUTHORS file.
  * You waive any claims and rights arising from Our authorized use of the Contribution, such as the right to be named as the author, to control modifications, to prevent Your identification as author, and right to prevent commercial usage, to the extent those rights would interfere with those You have granted Us.
* **4. Contribution Ownership**
  * You continue to retain all ownership rights to Your contribution, including any and all Copyright and patent claims.
  * Any and all rights You grant to Ixion are not exclusive, and You may grant them to other third parties.
  * In the event that You transfer Your ownership rights to any third party, Ixion will retain the rights You have granted us.
* **5. General**
  * **Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to allow Us to convey your Contribution in any fashion which would violate the terms of a GPLv3 license** which lacks Additional Permissions. For example, We may not, even with this license You are granting to Us, convey your Contribution without the underlying source code, or remove the copyleft nature of the GPLv3 from Your Contribution.
  * **All Contributions currently in the Ixion repository for which You own the Copyright and patent claims to will be subject to this Agreement**, as written at the time of your most recent Contribution to Us, regardless of when the Contributions were added to the repository. 
  * **This Agreement applies even if the Pull Request is later closed**, by either You or Us, without being merged.
