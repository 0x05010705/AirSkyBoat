- Subjob restriction (e.g. in cop dynamis) should now properly apply and be removed. (tiberon) players will now lose hp/mp/stats/spells/abilites which are derived only from their subjob.

- Adds diabolos bosses and css to dyna tav adds the inital cop dyna cs to touching the heiro to other cop dyna zones (1 cs, repeated across all 3, can see it once)  ## known todos - the umbral diabolos are supposed to be npcs - not mobs.  they function as they did in era - but are not npcs. - technically, when multiple diabolos are spawned - they should have their max hp reduced.  this supposedly works as a cap they cannot regen or rest over - so they will show as 80%, 60%, 40% (iirc).
